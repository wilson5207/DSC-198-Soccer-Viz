#Project Description:
What was our shape leading up to and during that play?

The UC San Diego Soccer coaches want a better tool to assess and communicate player spacing (shape) during key moments of the competition. While game film is available, they are not pleased with the sideline angle for reference to spacing across the field or players not in screen. While opponent location is not available, the UCSD players use a wearable GPS tracking device. The coaches want an app that allows them to go to key moments of the game by time stamp annotation, and visualize the location / distribution of the players during that play.
